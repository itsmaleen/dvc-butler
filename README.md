# Tauri + React + Typescript

This template should help get you started developing with Tauri, React and Typescript in Vite.

## Getting Started

### 1. Install Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have all the required dependencies for Tauri development. Follow the official guide to install Rust, Node.js, and other platform-specific requirements:

- [Tauri Prerequisites](https://v2.tauri.app/start/prerequisites/)

### 2. Install Project Dependencies

After installing the prerequisites, install the project dependencies using [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/):

```sh
pnpm install
```

### 3. Start the Development Server

To start the Tauri development environment, run:

```sh
pnpm tauri dev
```

This will launch both the Vite development server and the Tauri application.
